# 100Days-of-Coding
1. [Write a program that takes three numbers and prints their sum. Every number is given on a separate line.](Day001.md)
2. [Write a program that reads the length of the base and the height of a right-angled triangle and prints the area. Every number is given on a separate line.](Day002.md)
3. [Write a program that greets the user by printing the word "Hello", a comma, the name of the user and an exclamation mark after it. See the examples below.](Day003.md)
4. [Write a program that reads an integer number and prints its previous and next numbers. See the example below.](Day004.md)
5. [N students take K apples and distribute them among each other evenly. The remaining (the indivisible) part remains in the basket. How many apples will each single student get? How many apples will remain in the basket?](Day005.md)
6. [After you complete the 10th level, what is the JavaScript code you got? ](Day006.md)
7. [If you adopted the "Follow the Left Wall" algorithm, you will complete Level 10. 
What is the JavaScript code you got? ](Day007.md)
8. [If you adopted the "Follow the Right Wall" algorithm, you will complete Level 10. 
What is the JavaScript code you got? 
How many blocks did you have left? 
Assign it to the variable remaining_blocks.](Day008.md)
9. [Given two timestamps of the same day: a number of hours, minutes and seconds for both of the timestamps. The moment of the first timestamp happened before the moment of the second one. Calculate how many seconds passed between them.](Day009.md)
10. [Given the integer N - the number of seconds that is passed since midnight - how many full hours and full minutes are passed since midnight?
The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 1339).
For example, if N = 3900, then 3900 seconds have passed since midnight. 
Therefore, the time now is 1:05am. 
So the program should print 1 65 - 1 full hour is passed since midnight, 65 full minutes passed since midnight.](Day010.md)
11. [Write a program to calculate the distance between two points.
To find the distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), all that you need to do is use the coordinates of these ordered pairs and apply some common sense. Begin with the most simplest formula and then incrementally arrive at the correct formula as you solve the test cases.

12. [Given a three-digit number. Find the sum of its digits.](Day012.md)
13. [Given an integer, print "odd" if it's odd and print "even" otherwise.](Day013.md)
14. [Given a month - an integer from 1 to 12, print the number of days in it in the year 2017.](Day013.md)
15. [Given three integers, print the least of them.](Day015.md)
16. [Given the year number. You need to check if this year is a leap year. If it is, print LEAP, otherwise print COMMON.
The rules in Gregorian calendar are as follows:
a year is a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 4 and is not exactly divisible by 100
a year is always a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 400](Day016.md]
